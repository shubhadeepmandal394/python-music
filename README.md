# Compose and Program Music in Python using Earsketch

## What is this project all about?

```
In this this project, I created a basic composition using the Python programming language in Earsketch.
I learned the basic Python functions in order to create a basic music composition. Learning basic 
Python functions will allow oneself to develop their skills in programming and diversify their knowledge
of various programming languages. Python has become increasingly popular in computer science; knowledge 
of Python is highly desired in the computer science industry.
